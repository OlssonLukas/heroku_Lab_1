The Endpoint URL: (I'm not sure if I understood this part correctly.  This is the endpoint to the added enpoint with my name)
https://pure-reaches-34318.herokuapp.com/lukasolsson

During the lab I set up a heroku account and then deployed my first application to it.  The application I deployed was the tutorial app provided by heroku.  After that I modifed the applicaiton to add a new endpoint to a view that had my name in the heading.  Then I tested this change to see if it worked locally using the "heroku local" command.  Once I was sure it worked, I pushed the changes to the deployed app and then opened it again.  After testing the new endpoint I was sure that it worked when my name popped up.  The main issues I ran into in this lab had to do with had to do with installing and running heroku commands.  For whatever reason the windows installer for heroku appears broken so I had to manueally change the environmental variable for it to work.  After I figured that out everything else was very straight forward.
